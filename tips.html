      <h3> The fastest ways to move </h3>
      <p> In Survival, the fastest way to move is sprinting while jumping roughly every second, standing on ice with trapdoors above you. The effects of Speed help too. </p>
      <p> When on the move, avoid soul, slime and honey blocks. Crouching will slow you down too, as well as the effects of Slowness. </p>
      <p> In Creative mode, try sprinting while flying. You go really fast. Soul Speed on boots will speed you up on soul blocks. </p>

      <h3> Finding ore </h3>
      <p> One of the best ways to find ore in Minecraft is to start a strip mine. </p>
      <p> A strip mine is a long horizontal mine at a specific Y level. </p>
      <p> For diamonds, it's best to start from Y levels 1-15. For iron, try Y level 50. </p>
      <p> For coal, level 60. And for Netherite (Ancient Debris) try levels 15-17 in the Nether. </p>
      <p> You can also find diamonds in village chests and other chests. </p>

      <h3> Never dig straight down </h3>
      <p> Never dig straight down in Survival. There are many lava lakes and mob-filled caves you could fall into. </p>
      <p> If you absolutely have to, stand in the middle of two blocks, mine one, then the other, in alternate patterns. </p>
      <p> This will allow you to see what's below you before you fall in. </p>

      <h3> The best ways to fight a blaze </h3>
      <p> Build a complete wall around the blaze spawner allowing them no space. Don't forget the roof. </p>
      <p> Then go outside the wall and break one block, and only one. Then you can attack them through the hole. </p>
    </div>

      <h3> Bring water buckets to the End </h3>
      <p> You can use them to surround yourself in water when endermen are attacking you. </p>
      <p> Endermen are allergic to water so they will not be able to get to you. </p>
      <p> You can also use them to break your fall off an obsidian pillar. </p>
      <p> You can also use Feather Falling on boots to break your fall, but you will still take some damage. </p>

      <h3> Bookshelves enchance your enchantment table </h3>
      <p> You can put 15 bookshelves in a 1-block high wall around your table to make it look especially nice. </p>
      <p> This will greatly enchance the power of the table and give you much better enchantments. </p>
      <p> Leave one block for the entrance. There are many other bookshelf formations that will look equally - or more - nice. </p>

      <h3> Always wear golden armour to the Nether </h3>
      <p> Always wear at least one piece of golden armour when entering the Nether. </p>
      <p> Piglins do not attack you when you wear golden armour unless you attack them or mine nearby Nether Gold. </p>

      <h3> Use ยง (section sign) </h3>
      <p> If you use ยง followed by a specific letter or number in a command or in the chat, it will make whatever you are writing colorful! </p>
      <p> a = green, b = blue, c = red, d = purple, e = yellow, f = white, to name a few. <p> 
      <p> Not all characters work! </p>

      <h3> Critical Hits </h3>
      <p> To deal the most damge to your enemy, jump, and while falling, hit. This deals more damage, often called a critical hit. </p>
      <p> It only works while you are falling. </p>
      <p> If you're attacking the Ender Dragon, keep in mind that attacking the head does more damage than to the body. </p>

      <h3> Furnace Variants </h3>
      <p> In order to smelt/cook items at double the speed, there are different furnace variants. </p>
      <p> Use a blast furnace to smelt ores faster, and a smoker to cook food faster. </p>
      <p> Cook unlimited food with no fuel on a campfire (or soul campfire)! Tap on it while holding food. </p>
      <p> Blast furnaces and smokers may be faster, but they use twice the amount of fuel! </p>

      <h3> Lawn Mower </h3>
      <p> If you want to clear tall grass and flowers from a section of land, place water in the middle of the area. </p>
      <p> This will break all of the vegetation it comes into contact with. </p>
      <p> There is a downside though, it is that the water can get annoying and you will have to pick up the water on the exact water source block. </p>

       <h3> Yummy! </h3>
       <p> The best way to harvest food from an animal, is to first set it on fire, then kill it before the fire burns out. </p>
       <p> This will drop cooked food automatically, and it saves a lot of cooking time. </p>
       <p> To get the most out of a vegetable crop, convert it into it's cooked form, such as baked potatoes, from potatoes. </p>
       <p> Usually this means to use a furnace, but some food recipes are in a crafting table as well.

      <h3> Yummy? </h3>
      <p> When you're starving and hurt, try rotten flesh if there is no other option. </p>
      <p> Sometimes rotten flesh does not give you hunger, and even if it does, just stay still until it wears off. </p>
      <p> You will be left with almost full hunger. </p>
